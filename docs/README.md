# Computer Vision Workshop

This repository contains all codes for Mecatron's Computer Vision Workshop. This is a intermediate level workshop.


## Overview

Participants will be using a capable computer to run object detection via computer vision package `OpenCV` in Python. The computer will be connected to an `Arduino UNO` via serial (USB) that will control 2 servo motors on a 2 axis gimbal. The gimbal will be moving a camera in 2 axis: pitch and yaw.

The aim of this will be for the camera to detect and "track" an object, moving the camera to have the object at the center of its frame.


## Components

1. Hook up
2. Computer running computer vision code
3. Arduino controlloing gimbal camera.
